---
The web application allows to sign in using Google OAuth2 and later on use locally generated JSON Web Token(JWT) to communicate between front-end and back-end.

On the back-end JWT authorization endpoints offer two token types â€” a short-living Access Token and a long-living Refresh Token.

---

## Common Usage

Django + React web application allows to:

- login to the web application using Google OAuth2

- have access to protected area only after being logged in

- without authentification to have access only to the landing page, which has only a Google login button

- view user email in navigation dropdown name after authentification, before that dropdown name is populated with Anonymous

- refresh JWT without logging the user out when only the access token has expired

Example of protected area that is available only to authentificated users

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ana-gujabidze/auth_with_google_oauth2_and_jwt.git
cd auth_with_google_oauth2_and_jwt/
```

Download Docker Desktop from [the official website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). It will automatically install docker compose for you.

Create `.env` file similar to `.env_sample` file and specify all environmental variables both for client and server sides.

---

### Run application locally

If virtual environment is available run the following command

```python
pip3 install -r server/requirements.txt
```

In order to run server successfully, first production build should be created and imported into root directory of the back-end project.

```bash
npm run build
mv build/ ../server/
```

From here server can be started successfully.

First make migrations and then start the server:

```python
python3 manage.py makemigrations

python3 manage.py migrate

python3 manage.py runserver
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in the browser and result should be the following :

### Build Images and Run Containers With Docker Client

Navigate to the source directory and from there run command in order to build the image

```bash
docker build -t django-auth-app .
```

After successful build, run the container by the command

```bash
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env django-auth-app
```

After running Django app image, in CLI server URL should appear, after following it, the result should be the following:
